# UNIPOLAR-stepper-motor-driver-using-at89c2051-and-uln2003
in this post you can find how to make diy unipolar stepper motor driver with step and dir features. im used at89c2051 as main controller and it half steps through code. it uses uln2003 to drive the stepper. in simple terms it is a driver board for unipolar stepper motors. its works like a4988 module.

in **89c2051_unipolar_driver** folder you can find files for proteus 8.0.
in this proteus project you can find the schematic and PCB layout for this project.

in **test_unipolar** you can find the arduino sketch for testing the board.

in **unipolar** folder you can find files for programming at89c2051. (ex. c files and HEX files).
